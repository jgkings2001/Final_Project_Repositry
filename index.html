            <p>For this task, we had to come up with 3 poster

                <p>Overall, I'm not totally satisfied with the current state of my incomplete website. Most objects in
                    place are where I want them to be which is good progress. However, I believe I am capable of making
                    a more complete and aesthetically pleasing website. Frustratingly, I thought that I had done all
                    worksheets but have not completed the fifth and final one! Furthermore, I believe I could have made
                    a better and more finished website if I had began assembling it sooner. That being said, I am happy
                    with my poster redesigns and my typography work, though the random system could be more random! When
                    I am able to I will make the much needed additions to this website as I don't believe it reflects my
                    proper abilities as a media student.
